# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
programmer focuses on writing code to solve a specific problem, while a software engineer takes a more holistic approach, considering the overall design and architecture of the software
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Phase 1: Planning.Phase 2: Requirements Analysis.Phase 3: Design.Phase 4: Coding.Phase 5: Testing.Phase 6: Deployment.Phase 7: Maintenance.Frequent SDLC Models.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:Waterfall, quality is managed through detailed planning and extensive testing at the end of the development phase. In Agile, continuous integration and testing are employed to ensure quality throughout the development process. Both approaches aim to deliver a final product without defects and meet quality standard

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its is the area of systems engineering that deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit tests focus on individual components, such as methods and functions, while integration tests check if these components work together properly.unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit tests focus on individual components, such as methods and functions, while integration tests check if these components work together properly.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project managerto analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?Misalignment Between Goals and Business Objectives. One of the most common challenges affecting project teams is misalignment between project goals and business objectives. ...
Communication. ...
Lack of Accountability. ...
Resource Allocation. ...
Scope Creep. ...
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenancethe process of modifying, changing, and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve performance, or adapt to a changing environment.” and explain the different types of maintenance activitiesCorrective Software Maintenance. Corrective software maintenance is the typical, classic form of maintenance (for software and anything else for that matter). ...
Preventative Software Maintenance. ...
Perfective Software Maintenance. ...
Adaptive Software Maintenance Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?honesty, fairness, leadership, integrity, compassion, respect, responsibility, loyalty, law-abiding,
